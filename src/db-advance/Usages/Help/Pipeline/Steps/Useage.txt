--backupDir,--bd				= Directory to store or retreive backups of the target database (used for --restore command as well). If not stated, it will be the current executable directory "\backups".
--backupFile, --bf 				= The desired name (defaults to "yyymmmdd-hhMMss - full backup-target database name.bak" if not specified) of backup file on backup. For restore, it will use the specified name or revert to most recent if not stated.
--packageDir, --pd				= Directory that will hold the packaged scripts as a *.zip file for --pack command. Defaults to current executable directory "\packages" if not specified.

Non-Deterministic:	No value is supplied for the version, and the incrementing row number in the versions table is used as the version when all scripts are applied to the target database.
